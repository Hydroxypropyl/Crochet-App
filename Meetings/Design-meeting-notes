============== Questions to ask =========

- level of security needed
- get feedback for UI
- features : should we be set on all of them?
- technology choice : thinking of using React. But no prior knowledge
- Do we need to keep track of the working hours and do we have to include it to the report?

=============== Meeting notes ============

- we'll see if our project fits to the requirements of this course
- final product is compared to the design document
- prioritize core functions, should also remain intact
- we can use figma to demo the project
- design gala focuses mostly on the idea of a software
- allocate tasks (write down responsibilities), lot of changes awaits
- depends on the team, whether we want to use unknown technologies, only one component of the project -> task allocation
- key/main focus is on development of the service, actual coding is only a part of this
- mobile app is not okay, must be web-based -> web service which has prettier mobile UI than desktop UI
- security only a consideration (hash passwords, secure text fields...), basic web service security
