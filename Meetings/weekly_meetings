# September, 7th 2023 : 11:00 - 12:00 meeting
- group registration
- description of project, list of technologies used.

#from 7th to 13th 
- each group member did a layout draft of the app.

#September, 14th 2023 : 11:00 - 12:00 meeting
- shared each group member's layout drafts : merged them and decided on a common version.
- goal and structure of the service : The user has access to a stitch glossary and tutorials of basic techniques. 
They can also use a stitch/row counter that can be associated to a project, like that the user can reload a previous counter when they start working on a specific project.
The point is to create some sort of crochet Swiss knife that has handy functionalities all in one. It's not very dynamic in the sense that the user can only create counters, not stitches nor tutorials.
We do not want to create a place where people can share tutorials, because that already exists and the app would lose its core functionality.
- basic idea of the dynamic functionality and preliminary technologies selected : React, Deno or Node for the technologies, dynamic functionality mainly in the counter and creation of projects linked to counters.
- project plan draft (project structure, tasks divided among group members, time to be used, preliminary schedule) : 

#September, 21st 2023 : 11:00 - 12:00

TBD : counters being named "Main counter" and then letting the possibility to the user to create as many counters as they want and also name them

# September, 28th 2023 : 11:00 - 12:00
Discussed the last details of the design document. The parts had been previously split between all the members. 

Discussed the importance of each feature to separate them into each successive increments. 

- The most important features are the row/stitch counter and the stitch database. Since they are independent they can be worked on simultanously.

First increment : deadline 15th October
- learn basics of React
- initialize the front and back end and determine the structure of the database. Design the architecture so as to allow a clear/dark mode switching.
Goal : have a skeleton of the app with a functioning menu.

Second increment : deadline 1st November
Goal 1: the user must be able to create a main counter and a secondary counter, and increase/decrease them.
Goal 2 : the user must be able to see the stitch glossary.

Third increment : deadline 17th November
Goal 1 : user can log in/log out.
Goal 2 : user can mark favorites, create projects and load them.
Goal 3 : user can search through the database.

Fourth increment : deadline 24th November
Goal : polishing the front page. Add the abbreviation guide.
Goal 2 : implement user preferences : language.

Testing and debug in all the increments.

Assignements for next week : Henna on the database, create the bottom menu bar. Mickael & Manon learn basics of React. Manon on backend and Mickael on frontend.

# October, 12th : 11:00-12:00 : Share progress
Created a basic React service with the menu bar. For the moment, issues with connecting the MongoDB database that is in a docker container, but since we'll be using one online in the long run, it should be okay.
Structure : container for the server, one for the client and one for the database.
For the moment the client has the possibility to create stitches, it's a debug and test feature. The URL must be hardcoded to have access to the page.

Still focus on the mobile version because that's what we announced. But it's React so the web version can be relatively easily created.

For the presentation, present the figma as a safe option. If we're advanced enough, show the code.

For the database, only create a few entries, shouldn't focus too much on adding a lot of content for the time being.
Henna is taking care of updating React to version 18.

For the presentation : present home page + login, stitch glossary & favorites, then projects & counters
- Mickael : home page + login
- Manon : stitch glossary & favorites
- Henna : projects & counters
